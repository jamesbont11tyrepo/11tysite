		<h3><a class="permalink" href="/posts/2023/09/miyazakis-plane-notes/">Miyazaki&#39;s Plane Notes</a></h3>
				<p>I remembered another Twitter thread I wanted to archive, and since it looks like one or two of my tweets in the thread were deleted somehow (wasn't me...was it?), I might as well rebuild and expand on my initial thoughts.</p>
<p>Last year, Masaaki Endo shared a layout sheet with some notes from Hayao Miyazaki, written during the production of Porco Rosso.</p>
<p><div class="postimg">
<img src="/images/posts/miyazakiplane1.png" alt="Masaaki Endo on Twitter (translated through DeepL): Regarding the 'plane skidding' that I tweeted yesterday, Mr. Miyazaki wrote an explanation of the trajectory that he wrote for reference when checking the layout of 'Porco Rosso', the top is a common mistake that everyone makes, and the bottom is the aircraft and trajectory when sinking. It's a relationship, and it's easier to understand because it's more conctrete than in words *smiley face with sweatdrop*">
</div></p>
<p><div class="postimg">
<img src="/images/posts/miyazakiplane2.png" alt="Layout sheet with two plane trajectories diving then rising drawn by Miyazaki. The top one shows a plene with its nose always following the arc, and the second one shows the plane lifting its nose first, and then the body follows after a while.">
</div></p>
<p>These sketches show a plane taking two different trajectories. The top trajectory, according to Endo, is what Miyazaki described as a common mistake made by animators. The bottom trajectory is what Miyazaki thought is the correct way to animate a plane ascending from a dive.</p>
<p>Notice the difference? The top arc shows the plane's nose always tracking with it, while the bottom arc shows the plane lifting its nose up, but the plane itself is still flying downward for a moment until it starts ascending. Miyazaki's right, the bottom trajectory is the correct one.</p>
<p>What makes the bottom example the correct one? Without getting too deep in the weeds, the bottom path demonstrates the four forces of flight: thrust, lift, weight, and drag.</p>
<p><div class="postimg">
<img src="/images/posts/flightforces.png" alt="Illustration of a plane facing left, with 'Thrust' pointing left from the propeller, 'Lift' pointing up from the roof, 'Weight' pointing down from the wheels, and 'Drag' pointing right from the tail.">
</div></p>
<p>When a plane is flying level, those four forces are in balance. When a plane ascends, decends, or turns, those forces aren't in balance - that's how it's able to change position and elevation. Since planes fly on Earth, or at least some planet with gravity, you need to convey these four forces on a flying object to make its animation in flight feel believable.</p>
<p>The top trajectory in Miyazaki's notes would work fine if it was flying in space, where only two forces are at work since there's no gravity: weight, and thrust. However, if a plane flying on Earth was animated like the top example, the audience wouldn't buy it because it would look like it's just flying weightlessly in the air.</p>
<p>Not only does animating all four forces on a plane make it look more believable and feel more real, it also adds tension to the scene, if you're watching a dogfight or a dramatic dive and the pilot's trying to lift the plane in the nick of time.</p>
<p>You can see a similar bit of business in this scene from Tamako Love Story with Kanna running into a gym in stockings and changing direction on the waxed floor, but is still traveling in the initial direction until she creates enough force to start moving in her new direction. It's nicely animated.</p>

		<h3><a class="permalink" href="/posts/2023/07/camerawork-in-animation/">Camerawork In Animation, Animation In Camerawork</a></h3>
				<div class="postimg">
	<img src="/images/posts/Eva Tweet 1.png" alt="Me on Twitter: I'm just noticing the camera work on this scene now, and I gotta say it's much better and more believable than most of the camera work I see on animated shows today. It actually feels like someone's operating a camera instead of float-panning across the area.">
<p><img src="/images/posts/Eva Tweet 2.png" alt="Me on Twitter continued: Slow-ins and slow-outs, fast-moving pans as if the cameraperson was panicking (justifiably, considering the scene), overshooting & trying to correct course while trying to track the action too...& if this was still shot w/ an animation camera & not scanned, even more impressive!"></p>
</div>
<p>A while back, I wrote some thoughts on Twitter about the portrayal of the camera in this scene from End of Evangelion. It's a [famous scene] <a href="https://sakugabooru.com/post/show/147316">1</a> animated by Mitsuo Iso, where Asuka and her Evangelion unit fight a drone. My tweets got more attention than I expected, but because it's Twitter, brevity is paramount, so I felt like expanding on these thoughts a bit. Plus, I wanted to archive the tweets because I really liked them.</p>
<div class="postvid">
	<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
	<source src="/images/posts/eoefight.webm" type="video/webm">
	</video>
</div>
<p>This scene is well-known among animation fans for the outstanding job Mitsuo did with the acting, and by giving everything a very convincing sense of weight, gravity, and resistance. Rightfully so - I watch it for minutes on end every time I see it somewhere. However, when this clip was retweeted, I noticed something while watching it that I never noticed before, and never see other fans discussing online. It's another component of this scene that was well-done for the same reasons mentioned above: the camerawork.</p>
<p>Before I get into that, let's first fast-forward to modern-day animation, particularly from Japan. If you watch Japanese animation from, say, 2010 onwards, you've probably noticed a decent number of shots trying to imitate handheld cameras. Take [this scene] <a href="https://sakugabooru.com/post/show/29030">2</a> from season 2 of Sound! Euphonium:</p>
<div class="postvid">
	<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
	<source src="/images/posts/euphonium1long.webm" type="video/webm">
	</video>
</div>
<p>This is a pretty typical example that I see often - static shots from a wide variety of angles, and they all move like a ghost floating around and observing the scene omnipresently. In context of each scene, and the show in general, none of these shots are from a character's POV, nor are they trying to convey a documentary-style feel to the footage. Almost every shot has the same amount of shake, and pretty similar camera movement too. I don't know why any of these shots are treated like handheld shots other than going for &quot;vibes&quot; or something, and I don't know why almost every shot uses this effect as it ends up ringing hollow from being overused, or even coming across as twee, in my opinion.</p>
<div class="postvid">

</div>
<p>This shot from [Sound! Euphonium: Our Promise] <a href="https://sakugabooru.com/post/show/113445">3</a> actually portrays a student's POV from their cell phone camera. It moves a bit differently and is slightly more aggressive than the shots in the previous clip, but when the character (and the camera) is standing still, the camera looks and feels the same as most of the other shots in the previous clip. In the context of the scene, the movement feels restrained, like it's trying to keep the visuals readable, but sacrifices that &quot;oomph&quot; that camera shake gives as a result.</p>
<div class="postvid">

</div>
<p>This scene from [Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 Thrice Upon a Time] <a href="https://sakugabooru.com/post/show/161985">4</a> (I'm calling it Eva 4.0 for short) can justify going handheld because there's a lot of area to cover with a 2.35 aspect ratio, and it's shown as mostly one take to try and add tension. For me, though, a lot of that tension is ruined by the camera moving at a pretty even pace, which gives it a similar floaty feel as the previous clips. I don't really feel the weight or inertia when it changes directions. The camera has no personality or urgency - it's the same omnipresent ghost-camera as before, watching over a random moment in time. I have a lot of other complaints with this scene, so combine those with everything else I've criticized so far, and instead of this feeling like a tense, difficult scene to watch, it's disturbing in an &quot;uncanny valley&quot; way. I keep thinking this part looks more like a cutscene in a video game than a scene in a film.</p>
<p>EDIT 10/21: There's an [interesting interview with production manager Kazumasa Narita] <a href="https://meetscareer.tenshoku.mynavi.jp/entry/20231020-narita">5</a> where he says this scene was shot in motion capture, which might explain why I thought the animation felt more like a video game cutscene. I wasn't guessing it was motion capture, so that surprised me.</p>
<p>What problems do these shots have in common? Except for the Eva 4.0 clip, the shake in almost all of the other shots is treated like a subtle effect. You may think gently shaking a camera would look subtle, but it's actually very noticeable even at that stage.</p>
<p>For comparison, here's what handheld camera footage looks like from a live-action film - in this case, [Saving Private Ryan] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za5TIKkRCTs&amp;pp=ygUVaGFuZGhlbGQgY2FtZXJhIHNob3Rz">6</a>. Pay attention not just to how the camera shakes, but also how the camera operator is moving to make it shake like that, the environment it's in (What's the ground like as they're walking? Is it totally flat? Kind of rough and hilly?), what's happening at that moment in the scene, and how the shake changes and adjusts according to all those factors.</p>
<div class="postvid">
	<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
	<source src="/images/posts/ryanhandheldlong.webm" type="video/webm">
	</video>
</div>
<p>Notice how the shaking is much more erratic, and it's never moving cleanly along just one or two axes at a time. It's chaotic, and it's very noticeable even in the calmer scenes.</p>
<div class="postvid">

</div>
<p>Compare those to the Euphonium shots:</p>
<div class="postvid">

</video></p>
</div>
<p>None of the camera moves in the Euphonium clips look like they're moving in an unpredictable or uncontrolled manner. In the second clip that's mimicking a cell phone, you can even make out the zig-zagging pattern for the camera if you watch carefully. The camera in Saving Private Ryan also tries keeping focus on the subject it's shooting, correcting its position if it drifts away. The operator's determined to keep focus on the subject at all times. The Eva 4.0 camera does try tracking Asuka most of the time, and it tracks Shinji for a couple moments, but it still looks like it's floating around from subject to subject, so it feels more casual than urgent.</p>
<p>If that doesn't convince you, grab your cell phone, turn on the camera, and watch how the screen moves as you hold it up and aim it at something. Now try making it move exactly like the camera does in the Euphonium clips. It's not natural at all.</p>
<p>That's enough complaining about how modern animation is treating the camera wrong. Going back to End of Evangelion, how does a scene from a 1997 film get the camera movement right that people using modern editing and post-production software don't seem to recreate well?</p>
<p>Simply put: by moving the camera the same way an animator moves characters. But how? The camera can't show itself on screen. It can't pose, it doesn't have a face. How do the principles of animation apply to the camera?</p>
<p>Because the camera - the imaginary one shooting the scene, not the animation camera shooting the film - exists in the same world as the characters, and the world's same rules of physics apply to the camera too. The camera has mass, the world has gravity pulling it down to the ground, and the operator has to fight those two forces in order to move it. The way to show those forces and the operator fighting them is to use techniques like slow-outs and slow-ins when the camera starts and stops moving, respectively.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with animation terms, slow-outs start by spacing character movement close together from one frame to the next. After a few frames, the movement shown between each frame gets bigger - this is used to animate something that's at a standstill (or just starting to move) and give it accelerating force. Think of a stopped car starting to accelerate, or a batter starting to take a swing. These things need inertia, and slow-outs help show that inertia.</p>
<p>Here, slow-outs are used on the still camera as it starts panning left to track the fallen weapon.</p>
<div class="postvid">
	<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
	<source src="/images/posts/slowout.webm" type="video/webm">
	</video>
</div>
<p>Once enough momentum has built up, the subject gains force and speed. As it moves faster, that's when the movement from frame to frame gets bigger. This means spacing the frames further apart - figuratively, not literally - to show acceleration and speed. You can see a little bit of this near the end of the clip above.</p>
<p>At some point, the object has to stop, either by itself or from other forces - that's where slow-ins enter the picture. They're the opposite of slow-outs: movement that's already spaced far apart gets closer together near the end to show an object slowing down or stopping.</p>
<p>In this part, the camera's already panning at top speed, and slow-ins make the movements smaller near the end to show the operator trying to slow down and stop all the force they previously built up to get the camera to that spot.</p>
<div class="postvid">
	<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
	<source src="/images/posts/eoehandheld1.webm" type="video/webm">
	</video>
</div>
<p>You've probably seen charts that animators put on their extremes, but if you don't know how to read them, this diagram from Richard Williams's excellent book on animation, The Animator's Survival Kit, shows how slow-ins and slow-outs are represented, with each mark indicating a frame. The location of the marks is not to scale, it just gives an approximate idea of how much or how little movement needs to be shown on the breakdowns or in-betweens.</p>
<div class="postimg">

</div>
<p>There's another cool thing the camera is doing with these principles. Iso - and maybe the film's DP, Hisao Shirai* - also has the camera do a little acting in this sequence. In a couple parts, it looks like the operator makes adjustments while moving the camera around, and at one point it even moves around like it's in a bit of a panic.</p>
<p>(* Side note: I don't know for certain whether it was mostly Iso or Shirai who made the final camera directions on this scene. On one hand, Iso is known for working on and directing all aspects of his scenes like they're a short film that just happens to be part of a film or TV episode and fits in with the larger production's storyline. On the other hand, animation DPs sometimes take an animator's camera directions and toss them aside if they think they have a better way to shoot the scene. I'm not well-read on Iso or other EoE crewmembers' interviews, so if this has been discussed, I'm simply not aware of it. If Iso hasn't talked about it before, I should ask him someday while both of us are still on Twitter.)</p>
<p>Watch how the camera darts around the general area of this scene, as if the operator isn't sure what to shoot, or where the action will go. Like Saving Private Ryan's human camera operator, this imaginary operator has a goal: stay focused on the subjects and get the footage. Sometimes the camera overshoots from where it wants to film, and has to quickly backtrack to where the action is - or where it's going.</p>
<p><div class="postvid">
<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
<source src="/images/posts/panic.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</div></p>
<p>You can even see the camera overshoot and then correct itself a little bit when this huge blade skids along the ground and the drone's severed arm lands nearby.</p>
<p><div class="postvid">
<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
<source src="/images/posts/overshoot.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</div></p>
<p>The camera does it again later on, when it focuses on the incoming drone (also spot the slow-outs and slow-ins at the beginning and end of the clip). This neat transition feels like the camera's rotating around inside the cockpit, but is actually two separate cuts.</p>
<p><div class="postvid">
<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
<source src="/images/posts/overshoot2.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
</div></p>
<p>When you think about it, making the camera act like this is a neat example of doing something in animation that would be rather hard to do in live-action. Animation by its nature is the antithesis of spontaneity. It requires planning, coordination, and practice to reach the final result - much like the Private Ryan clip, as it's an effects shot. Private Ryan's actors, stunt coordinators, directors, and camera crew planned, coordinated, and practiced the scene to make sure they gave their best performance, the effects went off at the right times and the right way, and the camera filmed all these moments at just the right spots and times so the crew didn't have to do (too) many takes, not to mention shooting outdoors with a limited window for daylight.</p>
<p>If Spielberg wanted the camera to pretend it was caught off guard by the attack and still try to capture footage despite their panic, he could have done that, but then that would be another complication to throw into an already complicated mix of things that could go wrong with the scene. It also probably didn't cross his mind, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p>While the handheld camera in Saving Private Ryan succeeds in giving the audience a more intimate and in-the-trenches feeling among the troops, the camera doesn't feel like one of the troops - it's still an all-knowing observer that knows what's coming and where it'll happen, and the camera moves from subject to subject with precision and confidence. Try as it might to avoid it, the scene still feels a little choreographed, if you're paying attention.</p>
<p>Iso's scene, on the other hand, takes advantage of animation's penchant for planning and makes the camera act like it's watching the scene unfold for the first time, simultaneous with an audience watching the film for the first time. There's a frentic energy coming from this imaginary, invisible person shooting the scene, and it perfectly mirrors the energy of the fight it's capturing. The animators, directors, voice actors, and effects and camera crews aren't performing (or drawing) these scenes live after extensive planning, though - they're recording their best work on paper and audio tape, and writing step-by-step instuctions for the DP to follow when they shoot the scenes to film.</p>
<p>Making the scene was by no means spontaneous, but it <strong>feels</strong> spontaneous while watching it - that's the cool, underappreciated trick of this scene. As hard as it probably was to make that scene in animation, it would be even harder to do the same thing the same way in live-action.</p>
<div class="postimg">
	<img src="/images/posts/Eva Tweet 3.png" alt="Richmond Lee: This is one of my favorite scenes in all of film. It's so damn VISCERAL. So skillfully executed! You're right, the camera work makes you feel like you're there! There's acting and drama in the way it pans around.">
</div>
<p>[Richmond Lee] <a href="https://art-eater.com">7</a> really nailed why this scene feels so good to watch - it really does feel visceral. I find myself tensing up my hands and jaw while watching it. The animation plays a large part in getting that feeling across to the audience, but the camerawork also plays a role because, like the characters it's filming, the camera is a character that's acting too.</p>
<p>Considering all the outstanding work that went into animating and filming that End of Evangelion fight scene, it's a particular shame to see the same level of detail and care not brought to the camera shooting the fight scene between Asuka and Shinji in Eva 4.0. There's a weird paradox - and maybe a sad irony - seeing a fight between two robots showing more emotion and humanity from the camera than a fight scene between two humans, where the camera feels as robotic and programmatic as the computer it came from.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> 9/28: A brief follow-up from asking Iso about this is <em>here</em>.</p>
