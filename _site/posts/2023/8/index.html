        <h3><a class="permalink" href="/posts/iso-follow-up/">Camerawork In Animation - So I Asked Mitsuo Iso...</a></h3>
                <p>I finally asked him - he even retweeted my post!</p>
<p><div class="postimg">
<img src="/images/posts/Iso Tweet 2.png" alt="My question, roughly translated into English from DeepL: @IsoMitsuo Hello. Please excuse the sudden question. I like the camera movement in this scene ( https://sakugabooru.com/post/show/147316 ). It feels like a human is operating the camera and is scared of this battle. Did you come up with all these subtle camera movements yourself, or did you work with your cinematographer?"></p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/Iso Tweet 3.png" alt="My question, roughly translated into English from DeepL, cont.: I also wrote an essay about the camera work in this scene. Specifically, how the camera acts as if it were a character, and how the camera movements seem much more believable than most current animation camera movements. wrote."></p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/Iso Tweet 4.png" alt="My question, roughly translated into English from DeepL, cont.: It's a pity that it's not Japanese. Thank you for your time. Also, thank you for your years of animation work! *hands pressed together emoji"></p>

</div></p>
<p>I'm honored that he retweeted my post, but...he didn't answer my question! Partial credit for effort?</p>

        <h3><a class="permalink" href="/posts/2023/09/miyazakis-plane-notes/">Miyazaki&#39;s Plane Notes</a></h3>
                <p>I remembered another Twitter thread I wanted to archive, and since it looks like one or two of my tweets in the thread were deleted somehow (wasn't me...was it?), I might as well rebuild and expand on my initial thoughts.</p>
<p>Last year, Masaaki Endo shared a layout sheet with some notes from Hayao Miyazaki, written during the production of Porco Rosso.</p>
<p><div class="postimg">
<img src="/images/posts/miyazakiplane1.png" alt="Masaaki Endo on Twitter (translated through DeepL): Regarding the 'plane skidding' that I tweeted yesterday, Mr. Miyazaki wrote an explanation of the trajectory that he wrote for reference when checking the layout of 'Porco Rosso', the top is a common mistake that everyone makes, and the bottom is the aircraft and trajectory when sinking. It's a relationship, and it's easier to understand because it's more conctrete than in words *smiley face with sweatdrop*">
</div></p>
<p><div class="postimg">
<img src="/images/posts/miyazakiplane2.png" alt="Layout sheet with two plane trajectories diving then rising drawn by Miyazaki. The top one shows a plene with its nose always following the arc, and the second one shows the plane lifting its nose first, and then the body follows after a while.">
</div></p>
<p>These sketches show a plane taking two different trajectories. The top trajectory, according to Endo, is what Miyazaki described as a common mistake made by animators. The bottom trajectory is what Miyazaki thought is the correct way to animate a plane ascending from a dive.</p>
<p>Notice the difference? The top arc shows the plane's nose always tracking with it, while the bottom arc shows the plane lifting its nose up, but the plane itself is still flying downward for a moment until it starts ascending. Miyazaki's right, the bottom trajectory is the correct one.</p>
<p>What makes the bottom example the correct one? Without getting too deep in the weeds, the bottom path demonstrates the four forces of flight: thrust, lift, weight, and drag.</p>
<p><div class="postimg">
<img src="/images/posts/flightforces.png" alt="Illustration of a plane facing left, with 'Thrust' pointing left from the propeller, 'Lift' pointing up from the roof, 'Weight' pointing down from the wheels, and 'Drag' pointing right from the tail.">
</div></p>
<p>When a plane is flying level, those four forces are in balance. When a plane ascends, decends, or turns, those forces aren't in balance - that's how it's able to change position and elevation. Since planes fly on Earth, or at least some planet with gravity, you need to convey these four forces on a flying object to make its animation in flight feel believable.</p>
<p>The top trajectory in Miyazaki's notes would work fine if it was flying in space, where only two forces are at work since there's no gravity: weight, and thrust. However, if a plane flying on Earth was animated like the top example, the audience wouldn't buy it because it would look like it's just flying weightlessly in the air.</p>
<p>Not only does animating all four forces on a plane make it look more believable and feel more real, it also adds tension to the scene, if you're watching a dogfight or a dramatic dive and the pilot's trying to lift the plane in the nick of time.</p>
<p>You can see a similar bit of business in this scene from Tamako Love Story with Kanna running into a gym in stockings and changing direction on the waxed floor, but is still traveling in the initial direction until she creates enough force to start moving in her new direction. It's nicely animated.</p>
