<img src="/images/posts/Iso Tweet 2.png" alt="My question, roughly translated into English from DeepL: @IsoMitsuo Hello. Please excuse the sudden question. I like the camera movement in this scene ( https://sakugabooru.com/post/show/147316 ). It feels like a human is operating the camera and is scared of this battle. Did you come up with all these subtle camera movements yourself, or did you work with your cinematographer?"></p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/Iso Tweet 3.png" alt="My question, roughly translated into English from DeepL, cont.: I also wrote an essay about the camera work in this scene. Specifically, how the camera acts as if it were a character, and how the camera movements seem much more believable than most current animation camera movements. wrote."></p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/Iso Tweet 4.png" alt="My question, roughly translated into English from DeepL, cont.: It's a pity that it's not Japanese. Thank you for your time. Also, thank you for your years of animation work! *hands pressed together emoji"></p>

<p>I'm honored that he retweeted my post, but...he didn't answer my question! Partial credit for effort?</p>
