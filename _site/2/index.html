				<p>Besides marveling at the impressive animation work <strong>James Baxter</strong> put into it, did you think <em>&quot;Wow, it's so smooth! He must've animated it on ones&quot;</em>?</p>
<p>If you did, I don't blame you, but what would you think if I told you that you're wrong?</p>
<p>It seems hard to believe, but if you watch the clip frame-by-frame, you'll see that very little of the 10-second clip is animated on ones. In fact, the few frames shot on ones are at the very beginning and end of the clip. Everything in between alternates between twos and threes, and a large chunk in the middle alternates between twos and threes every frame. The animation timing actually changes almost every frame - it doesn't fluctuate wildly, but there isn't one part that's cruising along on ones, twos, or threes.</p>

		<h3><a class="permalink" href="/posts/iso-follow-up/">Camerawork In Animation - So I Asked Mitsuo Iso...</a></h3>
				<p>I finally asked him - he even retweeted my post!</p>
<p><div class="postimg">
<img src="/images/posts/Iso Tweet 2.png" alt="My question, roughly translated into English from DeepL: @IsoMitsuo Hello. Please excuse the sudden question. I like the camera movement in this scene ( https://sakugabooru.com/post/show/147316 ). It feels like a human is operating the camera and is scared of this battle. Did you come up with all these subtle camera movements yourself, or did you work with your cinematographer?"></p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/Iso Tweet 3.png" alt="My question, roughly translated into English from DeepL, cont.: I also wrote an essay about the camera work in this scene. Specifically, how the camera acts as if it were a character, and how the camera movements seem much more believable than most current animation camera movements. wrote."></p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/Iso Tweet 4.png" alt="My question, roughly translated into English from DeepL, cont.: It's a pity that it's not Japanese. Thank you for your time. Also, thank you for your years of animation work! *hands pressed together emoji"></p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/Iso Tweet 5.png" alt="The Retweets section of my post showing that Mitsuo Iso retweeted it">
</div></p>
<p>I'm honored that he retweeted my post, but...he didn't answer my question! Partial credit for effort?</p>
