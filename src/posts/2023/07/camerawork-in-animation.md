A while back, I wrote these thoughts on Twitter about the portrayal of the camera in this scene from End of Evangelion.

{% image "eva-tweet-1.png", "Me on Twitter: I'm just noticing the camera work on this scene now, and I gotta say it's much better and more believable than most of the camera work I see on animated shows today. It actually feels like someone's operating a camera instead of float-panning across the area." %}

{% image "eva-tweet-2.png", "Me on Twitter continued: Slow-ins and slow-outs, fast-moving pans as if the cameraperson was panicking (justifiably, considering the scene), overshooting & trying to correct course while trying to track the action too...& if this was still shot w/ an animation camera & not scanned, even more impressive!" %}

It's a [famous scene][1] animated by Mitsuo Iso, where Asuka and her Evangelion unit fight a drone. My tweets got more attention than I expected, but because it's Twitter, brevity is paramount, so I felt like expanding on these thoughts a bit. Plus, I wanted to archive the tweets because I really liked them.

This scene is well-known among animation fans for the outstanding job Mitsuo did with the acting, and by giving everything a very convincing sense of weight, gravity, and resistance. Rightfully so - I watch it for minutes on end every time I see it somewhere. However, when this clip was retweeted, I noticed something while watching it that I never noticed before, and never see other fans discussing online. It's another component of this scene that was well-done for the same reasons mentioned above: 

The camerawork.
			
Before I get into that, let's first fast-forward to modern-day animation, particularly from Japan. 

If you watch Japanese animation from, say, 2010 onwards, you've probably noticed a decent number of shots trying to imitate handheld cameras. Take [this scene][2] from season 2 of Sound! Euphonium:

This is a pretty typical example that I see often - static shots from a wide variety of angles, and they all move like a ghost floating around and observing the scene omnipresently. In context of each scene, and the show in general, none of these shots are from a character's POV, nor are they trying to convey a documentary-style feel to the footage. 

Almost every shot has the same amount of shake, and pretty similar camera movement too. I don't know why any of these shots are treated like handheld shots other than going for "vibes" or something, and I don't know why almost every shot uses this effect as it ends up ringing hollow from being overused, or even coming across as twee.

This shot from [Sound! Euphonium: Our Promise][3] actually portrays a student's POV from their cell phone camera. It moves a bit differently and is slightly more aggressive than the shots in the previous clip, but when the character (and the camera) is standing still, the camera looks and feels the same as most of the other shots in the previous clip. In the context of the scene, the movement feels restrained, like it's trying to keep the visuals readable, but sacrifices that "oomph" that camera shake gives as a result.

This scene from [Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 Thrice Upon a Time][4] (I'm calling it Eva 4.0 for short) can justify going handheld because there's a lot of vertical area to cover with a 2.35 aspect ratio, and it's shown as mostly one take to try and add tension.

<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
<source src="_site/assets/videos/eva4handheld.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
						
For me, though, a lot of that tension is ruined by the camera moving at a pretty even pace, which gives it a similar floaty feel as the previous clips. I don't really feel the weight or inertia when it changes directions. The camera has no personality or urgency - it's the same omnipresent ghost-camera as before, watching over a random moment in time. 

I have a lot of other complaints with this scene, so combine those with everything else I've criticized so far, and instead of this feeling like a tense, difficult scene to watch, it's disturbing in an uncanny valley way. I keep thinking this part looks more like a cutscene in a video game than a scene in a film.*

<aside>* EDIT 10/21: There's an <a href="https://meetscareer.tenshoku.mynavi.jp/entry/20231020-narita">interesting interview with production manager Kazumasa Narita</a> where he says this scene was shot in motion capture, which surprised me, but it might explain why I thought the animation looked more like a video game cutscene.</aside>
			
What problems do these shots have in common? Except for the Eva 4.0 clip, the shake in almost all of the other shots is treated like a subtle effect. You may think gently shaking a camera would look subtle, but it's actually very noticeable even at that stage. 
			
For comparison, here's what handheld camera footage looks like from a live-action film - in this case, [Saving Private Ryan][6]. Pay attention not just to how the camera shakes, but also how the camera operator is moving to make it shake like that, the environment it's in (What's the ground like as they're walking? Is it totally flat? Kind of rough and hilly?), what's happening at that moment in the scene, and how the shake changes and adjusts according to all those factors.

Notice how the shaking is much more erratic, and it's never moving cleanly along just one or two axes at a time. It's chaotic, and it's very noticeable even in the calmer scenes.

Compare those to the Euphonium shots:

<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
<source src="_site/assets/videos/euphonium2short.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
			
None of the camera moves in the Euphonium clips look like they're moving in an unpredictable or uncontrolled manner. In the second clip that's mimicking a cell phone, you can even make out the zig-zagging pattern for the camera if you watch carefully. 

The camera in Saving Private Ryan also tries keeping focus on the subject it's shooting, correcting its position if it drifts away - the operator's determined to keep focus on the subject at all times. The Eva 4.0 camera does try tracking Asuka most of the time, and it tracks Shinji for a couple moments, but it still looks like it's floating around from subject to subject, coming across as more casual than urgent.
			
If that doesn't convince you, grab your cell phone, turn on the camera, and watch how the screen moves as you hold it up and aim it at something. 

Now try making it move exactly like the camera does in the Euphonium clips. 

It's not natural at all.
			
Alright, enough complaining about how modern animation is treating the camera wrong. Going back to End of Evangelion, how does a scene from a 1997 film get the camera movement right that people using modern editing and post-production software don't seem to recreate well?

Simply put: by moving the camera the same way an animator moves characters. 

But how? The camera can't show itself on screen. It can't pose, it doesn't have a face. How do the principles of animation apply to the camera?
			
Because the camera - the imaginary one shooting the scene, not the animation camera shooting the film - exists in the same world as the characters, and the world's same rules of physics apply to the camera too. The camera has mass, the world has gravity pulling it down to the ground, and the operator has to fight those two forces in order to move it. The way to show those forces and the operator fighting them is to use techniques like slow-outs and slow-ins when the camera starts and stops moving, respectively.
			
Slow-outs start by spacing character movement close together from one frame to the next. After a few frames, the movement shown between each frame gets bigger - this is used to animate something that's at a standstill (or just starting to move) and give it accelerating force. Think of a stopped car starting to accelerate, or a batter starting to take a swing. These things need inertia, and slow-outs help show that inertia.
			
In this clip, the in-film camera uses slow-outs as it starts panning left to track the fallen weapon.

<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
<source src="_site/assets/videos/slowout.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
			
Once enough momentum has built up, the subject gains force and speed. As it moves faster, that's when the movement from frame to frame gets bigger. This means spacing the frames further apart - figuratively, not literally - to show acceleration and speed. You can see a little bit of this near the end of the clip above.
			
At some point, the object has to stop, either by itself or from other forces - that's where slow-ins enter the picture. They're the opposite of slow-outs: movement that's already spaced far apart gets closer together near the end to show an object slowing down or stopping.
			
In this part, the camera's already panning at top speed, and slow-ins make the movements smaller near the end to show the operator trying to slow down and stop all the force they previously built up to get the camera to that spot.

You've probably seen charts that animators put on their extremes, but if you don't know how to read them, this diagram from Richard Williams's excellent book on animation, The Animator's Survival Kit, shows how slow-ins and slow-outs are represented, with each mark indicating a frame. The location of the marks is not to scale, it just gives an approximate idea of how much or how little movement needs to be shown on the breakdowns or in-betweens.

{% image "williams-chart.png", "Excerpt from The Animator's Survival Kit showing a cartoon mouse with a movement arc and hashmarks on the arc, indicating where the extremes, breakdowns, and in-betweens belong in the arc, followed by examples of the charts seen on animation sheets with a straight line and marks, away from the drawings." %}

There's another cool thing the camera is doing with these principles. Iso - and maybe the film's DP, Hisao Shirai* - also has the camera do a little acting in this sequence. In a couple parts, it looks like the operator makes adjustments while moving the camera around, and at one point it even moves around like it's in a bit of a panic.

<aside>* I don't know for certain whether it was mostly Iso or Shirai who made the final camera directions on this scene. On one hand, Iso is known for working on and directing all aspects of his scenes like they're a short film that just happens to be part of a film or TV episode and fits in with the larger production's storyline. On the other hand, animation DPs sometimes take an animator's camera directions and toss them aside if they think they have a better way to shoot the scene. I'm not well-read on Iso or other EoE crewmembers' interviews, so if this has been discussed, I'm simply not aware of it. If Iso hasn't talked about it before, I should ask him someday while both of us are still on Twitter.<br /><br />EDIT 9/28: A brief follow-up from asking Iso about this is *here*.</aside> 
			
Watch how the camera darts around the general area of this scene, as if the operator isn't sure what to shoot, or where the action will go. Like Saving Private Ryan's human camera operator, this imaginary operator has a goal: stay focused on the subjects and get the footage. Sometimes the camera overshoots from where it wants to film, and has to quickly backtrack to where the action is - or where it's going.

<video controls loop controlslist="nodownload" preload="auto">
<source src="_site/assets/videos/panic.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

You can even see the camera overshoot and then correct itself a little bit when this huge blade skids along the ground and the drone's severed arm lands nearby.

The camera does it again later on, when it focuses on the incoming drone (also spot the slow-outs and slow-ins at the beginning and end of the clip). This neat transition feels like the camera's rotating around inside the cockpit, but is actually two separate cuts.

When you think about it, making the camera act like this is a neat example of doing something in animation that would be rather hard to do in live-action. Animation by its nature is the antithesis of spontaneity. It requires planning, coordination, and practice to reach the final result - much like the Private Ryan clip, as it's an effects shot. Private Ryan's actors, stunt coordinators, directors, and camera crew planned, coordinated, and practiced the scene to make sure they gave their best performance, the effects went off at the right times and the right way, and the camera filmed all these moments at just the right spots and times so the crew didn't have to do (too) many takes, not to mention shooting outdoors with a limited window for daylight.
			
If Spielberg wanted the camera to pretend it was caught off guard by the attack and still try to capture footage despite their panic, he could have done that, but then that would be another complication to throw into an already complicated mix of things that could go wrong with the scene. It also probably didn't cross his mind, but that's neither here nor there.
			
While the handheld camera in Saving Private Ryan succeeds in giving the audience a more intimate and in-the-trenches feeling among the troops, the camera doesn't feel like one of the troops - it's still an all-knowing observer that knows what's coming and where it'll happen, and the camera moves from subject to subject with precision and confidence. Try as it might to avoid it, the scene still feels a little choreographed, if you're paying attention.
			
Iso's scene, on the other hand, takes advantage of animation's penchant for planning and makes the camera act like it's watching the scene unfold for the first time, simultaneous with an audience watching the film for the first time. There's a frentic energy coming from this imaginary, invisible person shooting the scene, and it perfectly mirrors the energy of the fight it's capturing. The animators, directors, voice actors, and effects and camera crews aren't performing (or drawing) these scenes live after extensive planning, though - they're recording their best work on paper and audio tape, and writing step-by-step instuctions for the DP to follow when they shoot the scenes to film.
			
Making the scene was by no means spontaneous, but it **feels** spontaneous while watching it - that's the cool, underappreciated trick of this scene. As hard as it probably was to make that scene in animation, it would be even harder to do the same thing the same way in live-action.

{% image "eva-tweet-3.png", "Richmond Lee: This is one of my favorite scenes in all of film. It's so damn VISCERAL. So skillfully executed! You're right, the camera work makes you feel like you're there! There's acting and drama in the way it pans around." %}
			
[Richmond Lee][7] really nailed why this scene feels so good to watch - it really does feel visceral. I find myself tensing up my hands and jaw while watching it. The animation plays a large part in getting that feeling across to the audience, but the camerawork also plays a role because, like the characters it's filming, the camera is a character that's acting too.

Considering all the outstanding work that went into animating and filming that End of Evangelion fight scene, it's a particular shame to see the same level of detail and care not brought to the camera shooting the fight scene between Asuka and Shinji in Eva 4.0. There's a weird paradox - and maybe a sad irony - seeing a fight between two robots showing more emotion and humanity from the camera than a fight scene between two humans, where the camera feels as robotic and programmatic as the computer it came from.
