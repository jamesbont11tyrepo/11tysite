Besides marveling at the impressive animation work **James Baxter** put into it, did you think *"Wow, it's so smooth! He must've animated it on ones"*?
				
If you did, I don't blame you, but what would you think if I told you that you're wrong?
				
It seems hard to believe, but if you watch the clip frame-by-frame, you'll see that very little of the 10-second clip is animated on ones. In fact, the few frames shot on ones are at the very beginning and end of the clip. Everything in between alternates between twos and threes, and a large chunk in the middle alternates between twos and threes every frame. The animation timing actually changes almost every frame - it doesn't fluctuate wildly, but there isn't one part that's cruising along on ones, twos, or threes.
