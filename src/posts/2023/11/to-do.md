Unordered to-do list:

- Add @media hover queries for touchscreen use with dropdown
- Rename "header.html" to "head.html" and update shortcodes too
- Build gallery layout
- Set up article font (regular, italic, bold)
- Is it possible to make Tags lists show full posts? Terminal gives me a "circular error" message since it's calling the tags collection within each post. Possible workaround?
- Set up RSS plugin
