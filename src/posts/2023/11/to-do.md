This is a **test sentence** before *my* ***to-do*** list.

- Add @media hover queries for touchscreen use with dropdown
- Rename "header.html" to "head.html" and update shortcodes too
- Build gallery layout
- Is it possible to make Tags lists show full posts? Terminal gives me a "circular error" message since it's calling the tags collection within each post. Possible workaround?
- Set up RSS plugin
- Change increment-5 pagination to jump to the beginning/end of posts instead
- Add 'max-width' in CSS for site and set to 1280px? (see https://wesort.co.uk/blog/writing/images-for-websites)
