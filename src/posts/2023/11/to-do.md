- Set up Image plugin and images file structure and naming convention
- Add CSS for unordered and ordered lists
- Make a two-column layout for articles? (Can I just modify the Post template, or do I need to modify Base? If I modify Base, do I need to make separate layouts for my galleries?)
- Build gallery layout
- Set up RSS plugin

Ordered list test:
1. Blah
2. Blah blah
3. Blah blah blah
