I like the camera movement in this scene ( https://sakugabooru.com/post/show/147316 ). It feels like a human is operating the camera and is scared of this battle. Did you come up with all these subtle camera movements yourself, or did you work with your cinematographer?">

Specifically, how the camera acts as if it were a character, and how the camera movements seem much more believable than most current animation camera movements. wrote.">

I'm honored that he retweeted my post, but...he didn't answer my question! Partial credit for effort?
